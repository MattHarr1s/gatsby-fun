    <p>ABOUT US AND THE SERVICES WE OFFER
      </p>

        <p>Hot Romance Reads Club is a newsletter delivering the best romance books to your inbox daily! We also provide
          marketing for authors. We are run by Rave Reads Press and do business as Hot Romance Reads, Dirty Little
          Secret Reads an Jamie Knight.</p>

        <p>We are a promotional newsletter, meaning that authors pay us to advertise their books in it. Our newsletters
          contain recommended new releases, discounted books and FREE books for our readers to enjoy! The books must be
          in the romance genre and must have some level of steam (no clean/religious romance, as our readers prefer some
          hate).</p>
